-- $usage
-- #Usage#
-- Navigation2D provides directional navigation (go left, right, up, down) for
-- windows and screens.  It treats floating and tiled windows as two separate
-- layers and provides mechanisms to navigate within each layer and to switch
-- between layers.  Navigation2D provides three different navigation strategies
-- (see <#Technical_Discussion> for details): /Line navigation/ and
-- /Side navigation/ feel rather natural but may make it impossible to navigate
-- to a given window from the current window, particularly in the floating
-- layer. /Center navigation/ feels less natural in certain situations but
-- ensures that all windows can be reached without the need to involve the
-- mouse. Another option is to use a /Hybrid/ of the three strategies,
-- automatically choosing whichever first provides a suitable target window.
-- Navigation2D allows different navigation strategies to be used in the two
-- layers and allows customization of the navigation strategy for the tiled
-- layer based on the layout currently in effect.
--
-- You can use this module with (a subset of) the following in your @~\/.xmonad\/xmonad.hs@:
--
-- > import XMonad.Actions.Navigation2D
--
-- Then add the configuration of the module to your main function:
--
-- > main = xmonad $ navigation2D def
-- >                              (xK_Up, xK_Left, xK_Down, xK_Right)
-- >                              [(mod4Mask,               windowGo  ),
-- >                               (mod4Mask .|. shiftMask, windowSwap)]
-- >                              False
-- >               $ def
--
-- /NOTE/: the @def@ argument to 'navigation2D' contains the strategy
-- that decides which windows actually get selected.  While the default
-- behaviour tries to keep them into account, if you use modules that
-- influence tiling in some way, like "XMonad.Layout.Spacing" or
-- "XMonad.Layout.Gaps", you should think about using a different
-- strategy, if you find the default behaviour to be unnatural.  Check
-- out the [finer points](#g:Finer_Points) below for more information.
--
-- Alternatively to 'navigation2D', you can use 'navigation2DP':
--
-- > main = xmonad $ navigation2DP def
-- >                               ("<Up>", "<Left>", "<Down>", "<Right>")
-- >                               [("M-",   windowGo  ),
-- >                                ("M-S-", windowSwap)]
-- >                               False
-- >               $ def
--
-- That's it. If instead you'd like more control, you can combine
-- 'withNavigation2DConfig' and 'additionalNav2DKeys' or 'additionalNav2DKeysP':
--
-- > main = xmonad $ withNavigation2DConfig def
-- >               $ additionalNav2DKeys (xK_Up, xK_Left, xK_Down, xK_Right)
-- >                                     [(mod4Mask,               windowGo  ),
-- >                                      (mod4Mask .|. shiftMask, windowSwap)]
-- >                                     False
-- >               $ additionalNav2DKeys (xK_u, xK_l, xK_d, xK_r)
-- >                                     [(mod4Mask,               screenGo  ),
-- >                                      (mod4Mask .|. shiftMask, screenSwap)]
-- >                                     False
-- >               $ def
--

--
-- > main = xmonad $ withNavigation2DConfig def $ def
--

-- $finer_points
-- #Finer_Points#
-- The above should get you started.  Here are some finer points:
--
-- Navigation2D has the ability to wrap around at screen edges.  For example, if
-- you navigated to the rightmost window on the rightmost screen and you
-- continued to go right, this would get you to the leftmost window on the
-- leftmost screen.  This feature may be useful for switching between screens
-- that are far apart but may be confusing at least to novice users.  Therefore,
-- it is disabled in the above example (e.g., navigation beyond the rightmost
-- window on the rightmost screen is not possible and trying to do so will
-- simply not do anything.)  If you want this feature, change all the 'False'
-- values in the above example to 'True'.  You could also decide you want
-- wrapping only for a subset of the operations and no wrapping for others.
--
-- By default, all layouts use the 'defaultTiledNavigation' strategy
-- specified in the 'Navigation2DConfig' (by default, line navigation is
-- used).  Many more navigation strategies are available; some may feel
-- more natural, depending on the layout and user:
--
--   * 'lineNavigation'
--   * 'centerNavigation'
--   * 'sideNavigation'
--   * 'sideNavigationWithBias'
--
-- There is also the ability to combine two strategies with 'hybridOf'.
--
-- To override the default behaviour for some layouts, add a pair (\"layout name\",
-- navigation strategy) to the 'layoutNavigation' list in the
-- 'Navigation2DConfig', where \"layout name\" is the string reported by the
-- layout's description method (normally what is shown as the layout name in
-- your status bar).  For example, all navigation strategies normally allow only
-- navigation between mapped windows.  The first step to overcome this, for
-- example, for the Full layout, is to switch to center navigation for the Full
-- layout:
--
-- > myNavigation2DConfig = def { layoutNavigation = [("Full", centerNavigation)] }
-- >
-- > main = xmonad $ withNavigation2DConfig myNavigation2DConfig
-- >               $ def
--
-- The navigation between windows is based on their screen rectangles, which are
-- available /and meaningful/ only for mapped windows.  Thus, as already said,
-- the default is to allow navigation only between mapped windows.  However,
-- there are layouts that do not keep all windows mapped.  One example is the
-- Full layout, which unmaps all windows except the one that has the focus,
-- thereby preventing navigation to any other window in the layout.  To make
-- navigation to unmapped windows possible, unmapped windows need to be assigned
-- rectangles to pretend they are mapped, and a natural way to do this for the
-- Full layout is to pretend all windows occupy the full screen and are stacked
-- on top of each other so that only the frontmost one is visible.  This can be
-- done as follows:
--
-- > myNavigation2DConfig = def { layoutNavigation   = [("Full", centerNavigation)]
-- >                            , unmappedWindowRect = [("Full", singleWindowRect)]
-- >                            }
-- >
-- > main = xmonad $ withNavigation2DConfig myNavigation2DConfig
-- >               $ def
--
-- With this setup, Left/Up navigation behaves like standard
-- 'XMonad.StackSet.focusUp' and Right/Down navigation behaves like
-- 'XMonad.StackSet.focusDown', thus allowing navigation between windows in the
-- layout.
--
-- In general, each entry in the 'unmappedWindowRect' association list is a pair
-- (\"layout description\", function), where the function computes a rectangle
-- for each unmapped window from the screen it is on and the window ID.
-- Currently, Navigation2D provides only two functions of this type:
-- 'singleWindowRect' and 'fullScreenRect'.
--
-- With per-layout navigation strategies, if different layouts are in effect on
-- different screens in a multi-monitor setup, and different navigation
-- strategies are defined for these active layouts, the most general of these
-- navigation strategies is used across all screens (because Navigation2D does
-- not distinguish between windows on different workspaces), where center
-- navigation is more general than line navigation, as discussed formally under
-- <#Technical_Discussion>.

-- $alternatives
-- #Alternatives#
--
-- There exist two alternatives to Navigation2D:
-- "XMonad.Actions.WindowNavigation" and "XMonad.Layout.WindowNavigation".
-- X.L.WindowNavigation has the advantage of colouring windows to indicate the
-- window that would receive the focus in each navigation direction, but it does
-- not support navigation across multiple monitors, does not support directional
-- navigation of floating windows, and has a very unintuitive definition of
-- which window receives the focus next in each direction.  X.A.WindowNavigation
-- does support navigation across multiple monitors but does not provide window
-- colouring while retaining the unintuitive navigational semantics of
-- X.L.WindowNavigation.  This makes it very difficult to predict which window
-- receives the focus next.  Neither X.A.WindowNavigation nor
-- X.L.WindowNavigation supports directional navigation of screens.

-- $technical
-- #Technical_Discussion#
-- An in-depth discussion of the navigational strategies implemented in
-- Navigation2D, including formal proofs of their properties, can be found
-- at <http://www.cs.dal.ca/~nzeh/xmonad/Navigation2D.pdf>.

-- $incompatibilities
-- #Incompatibilities#
-- Currently Navigation2D is known not to play nicely with tabbed layouts, but
-- it should work well with any other tiled layout.  My hope is to address the
-- incompatibility with tabbed layouts in a future version.  The navigation to
-- unmapped windows, for example in a Full layout, by assigning rectangles to
-- unmapped windows is more a workaround than a clean solution.  Figuring out
-- how to deal with tabbed layouts may also lead to a more general and cleaner
-- solution to query the layout for a window's rectangle that may make this
-- workaround unnecessary.  At that point, the 'unmappedWindowRect' field of the
-- 'Navigation2DConfig' will disappear.

-- | Line navigation.  To illustrate this navigation strategy, consider
-- navigating to the left from the current window.  In this case, we draw a
-- horizontal line through the center of the current window and consider all
-- windows that intersect this horizontal line and whose right boundaries are to
-- the left of the left boundary of the current window.  From among these
-- windows, we choose the one with the rightmost right boundary.
lineNavigation :: Navigation2D
lineNavigation = N 1 doLineNavigation

-- | Center navigation.  Again, consider navigating to the left.  Then we
-- consider the cone bounded by the two rays shot at 45-degree angles in
-- north-west and south-west direction from the center of the current window.  A
-- window is a candidate to receive the focus if its center lies in this cone.
-- We choose the window whose center has minimum L1-distance from the current
-- window center.  The tie breaking strategy for windows with the same distance
-- is a bit complicated (see <#Technical_Discussion>) but ensures that all
-- windows can be reached and that windows with the same center are traversed in
-- their order in the window stack, that is, in the order
-- 'XMonad.StackSet.focusUp' and 'XMonad.StackSet.focusDown' would traverse
-- them.
centerNavigation :: Navigation2D
centerNavigation = N 2 doCenterNavigation

-- | Side navigation. Consider navigating to the right this time. The strategy
-- is to take the line segment forming the right boundary of the current window,
-- and push it to the right until it intersects with at least one other window.
-- Of those windows, one with a point that is the closest to the centre of the
-- line (+1) is selected. This is probably the most intuitive strategy for the
-- tiled layer when using "XMonad.Layout.Spacing".
sideNavigation :: Navigation2D
sideNavigation = N 1 (doSideNavigationWithBias 1)

-- | Side navigation with bias. Consider a case where the screen is divided
-- up into three vertical panes; the side panes occupied by one window each and
-- the central pane split across the middle by two windows. By the criteria
-- of side navigation, the two central windows are equally good choices when
-- navigating inwards from one of the side panes. Hence in order to be
-- equitable, symmetric and pleasant to use, different windows are chosen when
-- navigating from different sides. In particular, the lower is chosen when
-- going left and the higher when going right, causing L, L, R, R, L, L, etc to
-- cycle through the four windows clockwise. This is implemented by using a bias
-- of 1. /Bias/ is how many pixels off centre the vertical split can be before
-- this behaviour is lost and the same window chosen every time. A negative bias
-- swaps the preferred window for each direction. A bias of zero disables the
-- behaviour.
sideNavigationWithBias :: Int -> Navigation2D
sideNavigationWithBias b = N 1 (doSideNavigationWithBias b)

-- | Hybrid of two modes of navigation, preferring the motions of the first.
-- Use this if you want to fall back on a second strategy whenever the first
-- does not find a candidate window. E.g.
-- @hybridOf lineNavigation centerNavigation@ is a good strategy for the
-- floating layer, and @hybridOf sideNavigation centerNavigation@ will enable
-- you to take advantage of some of the latter strategy's more interesting
-- motions in the tiled layer.
