Module      :  XMonad.Actions.WindowGo
Description :  Operations for raising (traveling to) windows.
License     :  Public domain

Maintainer  :  <gwern0@gmail.com>
Stability   :  unstable
Portability :  unportable

Defines a few convenient operations for raising (traveling to) windows based on XMonad's Query
monad, such as 'runOrRaise'. runOrRaise will run a shell command unless it can
find a specified window; you would use this to automatically travel to your
Firefox or Emacs session, or start a new one (for example), instead of trying to
remember where you left it or whether you still have one running. -}

{- $usage

Import the module into your @~\/.xmonad\/xmonad.hs@:

> import XMonad.Actions.WindowGo

and define appropriate key bindings:

> , ((modm .|. shiftMask, xK_g), raise (className =? "Firefox"))
> , ((modm .|. shiftMask, xK_b), runOrRaise "firefox" (className =? "Firefox"))

(Note that Firefox v3 and up have a class-name of \"Firefox\" and \"Navigator\";
lower versions use other classnames such as \"Firefox-bin\". Either choose the
appropriate one, or cover your bases by using instead something like:

> (className =? "Firefox" <||> className =? "Firefox-bin")

For detailed instructions on editing your key bindings, see
<https://xmonad.org/TUTORIAL.html#customizing-xmonad the tutorial>.

-- second parameter.

ifWindows qry f el = withWindowSet $ \wins -> do
  matches <- filterM (runQuery qry) $ allWindowsSorted wins
  case matches of
    [] -> el
    ws -> f ws

-- | The same as ifWindows, but applies a ManageHook to the first match
-- instead and discards the other matches
ifWindow :: Query Bool -> ManageHook -> X () -> X ()
ifWindow qry mh = ifWindows qry (windows . appEndo <=< runQuery mh . NE.head . notEmpty)
-- ifWindows guarantees that the list given to the function is
-- non-empty. This should really use Data.List.NonEmpty, but, alas,
-- that would be a breaking change.

{- | 'action' is an executable to be run via 'safeSpawnProg' (of "XMonad.Util.Run") if the Window cannot be found.
   Presumably this executable is the same one that you were looking for.
   Note that this does not go through the shell. If you wish to run an arbitrary IO action
   (such as 'spawn', which will run its String argument through the shell), then you will want to use
   'raiseMaybe' directly. -}
runOrRaise :: String -> Query Bool -> X ()
runOrRaise = raiseMaybe . safeSpawnProg

-- | See 'raiseMaybe'. If the Window can't be found, quietly give up and do nothing.
raise :: Query Bool -> X ()
raise = raiseMaybe $ return ()

{- | 'raiseMaybe' queries all Windows based on a boolean provided by the
   user. Currently, there are 3 such useful booleans defined in
   "XMonad.ManageHook": 'title', 'resource', 'className'. Each one tests based pretty
   much as you would think. ManageHook also defines several operators, the most
   useful of which is (=?). So a useful test might be finding a @Window@ whose
   class is Firefox. Firefox 3 declares the class \"Firefox\", so you'd want to
   pass in a boolean like @(className =? \"Firefox\")@.

   If the boolean returns @True@ on one or more windows, then XMonad will quickly
   make visible the first result. If no @Window@ meets the criteria, then the
   first argument comes into play.

   The first argument is an arbitrary IO function which will be executed if the
   tests fail. This is what enables 'runOrRaise' to use 'raiseMaybe': it simply runs
   the desired program if it isn't found. But you don't have to do that. Maybe
   you want to do nothing if the search fails (the definition of 'raise'), or
   maybe you want to write to a log file, or call some prompt function, or
   something crazy like that. This hook gives you that flexibility. You can do
   some cute things with this hook. Suppose you want to do the same thing for
   Mutt which you just did for Firefox - but Mutt runs inside a terminal window?
   No problem: you search for a terminal window calling itself \"mutt\", and if
   there isn't you run a terminal with a command to run Mutt! Here's an example
   (borrowing 'runInTerm' from "XMonad.Util.Run"):

  > , ((modm, xK_m), raiseMaybe (runInTerm "-title mutt" "mutt") (title =? "mutt"))

     'raiseNextMaybe' is an alternative version that allows cycling

     the function f is executed. -}
