{- $usage

Import the module into your @~\/.xmonad\/xmonad.hs@:

> import XMonad.Actions.GroupNavigation

To support cycling forward and backward through all xterm windows, add
something like this to your keybindings:

> , ((modm              , xK_t), nextMatch Forward  (className =? "XTerm"))
> , ((modm .|. shiftMask, xK_t), nextMatch Backward (className =? "XTerm"))

These key combinations do nothing if there is no xterm window open.
If you rather want to open a new xterm window if there is no open
xterm window, use 'nextMatchOrDo' instead:

> , ((modm              , xK_t), nextMatchOrDo Forward  (className =? "XTerm") (spawn "xterm"))
> , ((modm .|. shiftMask, xK_t), nextMatchOrDo Backward (className =? "XTerm") (spawn "xterm"))

You can use 'nextMatchWithThis' with an arbitrary query to cycle
through all windows for which this query returns the same value as the
current window.  For example, to cycle through all windows in the same
window class as the current window use:

> , ((modm , xK_f), nextMatchWithThis Forward  className)
> , ((modm , xK_b), nextMatchWithThis Backward className)

Finally, you can define keybindings to jump to the most recent window
matching a certain Boolean query.  To do this, you need to add
'historyHook' to your logHook:

> main = xmonad $ def { logHook = historyHook }

Then the following keybindings, for example, allow you to return to
the most recent xterm or emacs window or to simply to the most recent
window:

> , ((modm .|. controlMask, xK_e),         nextMatch History (className =? "Emacs"))
> , ((modm .|. controlMask, xK_t),         nextMatch History (className =? "XTerm"))
> , ((modm                , xK_BackSpace), nextMatch History (return True))

Again, you can use 'nextMatchOrDo' instead of 'nextMatch' if you want
to execute an action if no window matching the query exists. -}
