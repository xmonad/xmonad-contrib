--
-- A workscreen permits to display a set of workspaces on several
-- screens. In xinerama mode, when a workscreen is viewed, workspaces
-- associated to all screens are visible.
--
-- The first workspace of a workscreen is displayed on first screen,
-- second on second screen, etc. Workspace position can be easily
-- changed. If the current workscreen is called again, workspaces are
-- shifted.
--
-- This also permits to see all workspaces of a workscreen even if just
-- one screen is present, and to move windows from workspace to workscreen.

-- $usage
-- You can use this module with the following in your @~\/.xmonad\/xmonad.hs@:
--
-- > import XMonad.Actions.Workscreen
-- > myWorkspaces = let myOldWorkspaces = ["adm","work","mail"]
-- >                in Workscreen.expandWorkspace 2 myOldWorkspaces
-- > myStartupHook = do Workscreen.configWorkscreen (Workscreen.fromWorkspace 2 myWorkspaces)
-- >                    return ()
--
-- Then, replace normal workspace view and shift keybinding:
--
-- > [((m .|. modm, k), f i)
-- >      | (i, k) <- zip [0..] [1..12]
-- >      , (f, m) <- [(Workscreen.viewWorkscreen, 0), (Workscreen.shiftToWorkscreen, shiftMask)]]
--
-- For detailed instructions on editing your key bindings, see
-- <https://xmonad.org/TUTORIAL.html#customizing-xmonad the tutorial>.
