-- $usage
--
-- To wire this up, first add:
--
-- > import XMonad.Hooks.UrgencyHook
--
-- to your import list in your config file. Now, you have a decision to make:
-- When a window deems itself urgent, do you want to pop up a temporary dzen
-- bar telling you so, or do you have an existing dzen wherein you would like to
-- highlight urgent workspaces?

-- $temporary
--
-- Enable your urgency hook by wrapping your config record in a call to
-- 'withUrgencyHook'. For example:
--
-- > main = xmonad $ withUrgencyHook dzenUrgencyHook { args = ["-bg", "darkgreen", "-xs", "1"] }
-- >               $ def
--
-- This will pop up a dzen bar for five seconds telling you you've got an
-- urgent window.

-- $existing
--
-- In order for xmonad to track urgent windows, you must install an urgency hook.
-- You can use the above 'dzenUrgencyHook', or if you're not interested in the
-- extra popup, install NoUrgencyHook, as so:
--
-- > main = xmonad $ withUrgencyHook NoUrgencyHook
-- >               $ def
--
-- Now, your "XMonad.Hooks.DynamicLog" must be set up to display the urgent
-- windows. If you're using the 'dzen' or 'dzenPP' functions from that module,
-- then you should be good. Otherwise, you want to figure out how to set
-- 'ppUrgent'.

-- $keybinding
--
-- You can set up a keybinding to jump to the window that was recently marked
-- urgent. See an example at 'focusUrgent'.

-- $troubleshooting
--
-- There are three steps to get right:
--
-- 1. The X client must set the UrgencyHint flag. How to configure this
--    depends on the application. If you're using a terminal app, this is in
--    two parts:
--
--      * The console app must send a ^G (bell). In bash, a helpful trick is
--        @sleep 1; echo -e \'\\a\'@.
--
--      * The terminal must convert the bell into UrgencyHint.
--
-- 2. XMonad must be configured to notice UrgencyHints. If you've added
--    withUrgencyHook, you may need to hit mod-shift-space to reset the layout.
--
-- 3. The dzen must run when told. Run @dzen2 -help@ and make sure that it
--    supports all of the arguments you told DzenUrgencyHook to pass it. Also,
--    set up a keybinding to the 'dzen' action in "XMonad.Util.Dzen" to test
--    if that works.
--
-- As best you can, try to isolate which one(s) of those is failing.

-- $example
--
-- This is a commonly asked example. By default, the window doesn't get flagged
-- urgent when somebody messages you in irssi. You will have to configure some
-- things. If you're using different tools than this, your mileage will almost
-- certainly vary. (For example, in Xchat2, it's just a simple checkbox.)

-- $irssi
-- @Irssi@ is not an X11 app, so it can't set the @UrgencyHint@ flag on @XWMHints@.
-- However, on all console applications is bestown the greatest of all notification
-- systems: the bell. That's right, Ctrl+G, ASCII code 7, @echo -e '\a'@, your
-- friend, the bell. To configure @irssi@ to send a bell when you receive a message:
--
-- > /set beep_msg_level MSGS NOTICES INVITES DCC DCCMSGS HILIGHT
--
-- Consult your local @irssi@ documentation for more detail.

-- $screen
-- A common way to run @irssi@ is within the lovable giant, @screen@. Some distros
-- (e.g. Ubuntu) like to configure @screen@ to trample on your poor console
-- applications -- in particular, to turn bell characters into evil, smelly
-- \"visual bells.\" To turn this off, add:
--
-- > vbell off # or remove the existing 'vbell on' line
--
-- to your .screenrc, or hit @C-a C-g@ within a running @screen@ session for an
-- immediate but temporary fix.

-- $urxvt
-- Rubber, meet road. Urxvt is the gateway between console apps and X11. To tell
-- urxvt to set an @UrgencyHint@ when it receives a bell character, first, have
-- an urxvt version 8.3 or newer, and second, set the following in your
-- @.Xdefaults@:
--
-- > urxvt.urgentOnBell: true
--
-- Depending on your setup, you may need to @xrdb@ that.

-- $xmonad
-- Hopefully you already read the section on how to configure xmonad. If not,
-- hopefully you know where to find it.

-- The Non-ICCCM Manifesto:
-- Note: Some non-standard choices have been made in this implementation to
-- account for the fact that things are different in a tiling window manager:
--   1. In normal window managers, windows may overlap, so clients wait for focus to
--      be set before urgency is cleared. In a tiling WM, it's sufficient to be able
--      see the window, since we know that means you can see it completely.
--   2. The urgentOnBell setting in rxvt-unicode sets urgency even when the window
--      has focus, and won't clear until it loses and regains focus. This is stupid.
-- In order to account for these quirks, we track the list of urgent windows
-- ourselves, allowing us to clear urgency when a window is visible, and not to
-- set urgency if a window is visible. If you have a better idea, please, let us
-- know!
