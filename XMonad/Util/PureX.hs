-- Unlike the opaque @IO@ actions that @X@ actions can wrap, regular reads from
-- the 'XConf' and modifications to the 'XState' are fundamentally pure—contrary
-- to the current treatment of such actions in most xmonad code. Pure
-- modifications to the 'WindowSet' can be readily composed, but due to the need
-- for those modifications to be properly handled by 'windows', other pure
-- changes to the @XState@ cannot be interleaved with those changes to the
-- @WindowSet@ without superfluous refreshes, hence breaking composability.
--
-- This module aims to rectify that situation by drawing attention to it and
-- providing 'PureX': a pure type with the same monadic interface to state as
-- @X@. The 'XLike' typeclass enables writing actions generic over the two
-- monads; if pure, existing @X@ actions can be generalised with only a change
-- to the type signature. Various other utilities are provided, in particular
-- the 'defile' function which is needed by end-users.

-- --< Usage >-- {{{

-- $Usage
--
-- The suggested pattern of usage for this module is to write composable, pure
-- actions as @XLike m => m Any@ or @PureX Any@ values, where the encapsulated
-- @Any@ value encodes whether or not a refresh is needed to properly institute
-- changes. These values can then be combined monoidally (i.e. with '<>' AKA
-- '<+>') or with operators such as '<*', '*>', '<?' and '&>' to build seamless
-- new actions. The end user can run and handle the effects of the pure actions
-- in the @X@ monad by applying the @defile@ function, which you may want to
-- re-export. Alternatively, if an action does not make stackset changes that
-- need to be handled by @windows@, it can be written with as an
-- @XLike m => m ()@ and used directly.
--
-- Unfortunately since layouts must handle messages in the @X@ monad, this
-- approach does not quite apply to actions involving them. However a relatively
-- direct translation to impure actions is possible: you can write composable,
-- refresh-tracking actions as @X Any@ values, making sure to eschew
-- refresh-inducing functions like @windows@ and @sendMessage@ in favour of
-- 'modifyWindowSet' and utilities provided by "XMonad.Actions.MessageFeedback".
-- The 'windowBracket_' function recently added to "XMonad.Operations" is the
-- impure analogue of @defile@. Note that @PureX Any@ actions can be composed
-- into impure ones after applying 'toX'; don't use @defile@ for this. E.g.
--
-- > windowBracket_ (composableImpureAction <> toX composablePureAction)
--
-- Although both @X@ and @PureX@ have Monoid instances over monoidal values,
-- @(XLike m, Monoid a)@ is not enough to infer @Monoid (m a)@ (due to the
-- open-world assumption). Hence a @Monoid (m Any)@ constraint may need to be
-- used when working with @XLike m => m Any@ where no context is forcing @m@ to
-- unify with @X@ or @PureX@. This can also be avoided by working with
-- @PureX Any@ values and generalising them with 'toXLike' where necessary.
--
-- @PureX@ also enables a more monadic style when writing windowset operations;
-- see the implementation of the utilities in this module for examples.
-- For an example of a whole module written in terms of this one, see
-- "XMonad.Hooks.RefocusLast".
