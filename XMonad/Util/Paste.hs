{- $usage

Import this module into your xmonad.hs as usual:

> import XMonad.Util.Paste

And use the functions. They all return 'X' (), and so are appropriate
for use as keybindings. Example:

>          , ((m,              xK_d), pasteString "foo bar") ]

Don't expect too much of the functions; they probably don't work on complex
texts.
-}

-- | Paste the current X mouse selection. Note that this uses 'getSelection' from
--   "XMonad.Util.XSelection" and so is heir to its flaws.
pasteSelection :: X ()
pasteSelection = getSelection >>= pasteString

-- | Send a string to the window which is currently focused. This function correctly
-- handles capitalization. Warning: in dealing with capitalized characters, this assumes a QWERTY layout.
pasteString :: String -> X ()
pasteString = mapM_ (\x -> if isUpper x || x `elem` "~!@#$%^&*()_+{}|:\"<>?" then pasteChar shiftMask x else pasteChar noModMask x)

{- | Send a character to the current window. This is more low-level.
   Remember that you must handle the case of capitalization appropriately.
   That is, from the window's perspective:

   > pasteChar mod2Mask 'F' ~> "f"

   You would want to do something like:

   > pasteChar shiftMask 'F'

   Note that this function makes use of 'stringToKeysym', and so will probably
   have trouble with any 'Char' outside ASCII.

pasteChar :: KeyMask -> Char -> X ()
pasteChar m c = sendKey m $ maybe (stringToKeysym [c]) fst
                $ listToMaybe $ readP_to_S parseKey [c]

sendKey :: KeyMask -> KeySym -> X ()
sendKey = (withFocused .) . sendKeyWindow

-- | The primitive. Allows you to send any combination of 'KeyMask' and 'KeySym' to any 'Window' you specify.
