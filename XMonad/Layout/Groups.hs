-- $usage
-- This module provides a layout combinator that allows you
-- to manage your windows in independent groups. You can provide
-- both the layout with which to arrange the windows inside each
-- group, and the layout with which the groups themselves will
-- be arranged on the screen.
--
-- The "XMonad.Layout.Groups.Examples" and "XMonad.Layout.Groups.Wmii"
-- modules contain examples of layouts that can be defined with this
-- combinator. They're also the recommended starting point
-- if you are a beginner and looking for something you can use easily.
--
-- One thing to note is that 'Groups'-based layout have their own
-- notion of the order of windows, which is completely separate
-- from XMonad's. For this reason, operations like 'XMonad.StackSet.SwapUp'
-- will have no visible effect, and those like 'XMonad.StackSet.focusUp'
-- will focus the windows in an unpredictable order. For a better way of
-- rearranging windows and moving focus in such a layout, see the
-- example 'ModifySpec's (to be passed to the 'Modify' message) provided
-- by this module.
--
-- If you use both 'Groups'-based and other layouts, The "XMonad.Layout.Groups.Helpers"
-- module provides actions that can work correctly with both, defined using
-- functions from "XMonad.Actions.MessageFeedback".

-- | Create a 'Groups' layout.
--
-- Note that the second parameter (the layout for arranging the
-- groups) is not used on 'Windows', but on 'Group's. For this
-- reason, you can only use layouts that don't specifically
-- need to manage 'Window's. This is obvious, when you think
-- about it.
