-- $usage
-- You can use this module with the following in your @~\/.xmonad\/xmonad.hs@:
--
-- > import XMonad.Layout.IndependentScreens
--
-- You can define your workspaces by calling @withScreens@:
--
-- > myConfig = def { workspaces = withScreens 2 ["web", "email", "irc"] }
--
-- This will create \"physical\" workspaces with distinct internal names for
-- each (screen, virtual workspace) pair.
--
-- Then edit any keybindings that use the list of workspaces or refer
-- to specific workspace names.  In the default configuration, only
-- the keybindings for changing workspace do this:
--
-- > keyBindings conf = let m = modMask conf in fromList $
-- >     {- lots of other keybindings -}
-- >     [((m .|. modm, k), windows $ f i)
-- >         | (i, k) <- zip (XMonad.workspaces conf) [xK_1 .. xK_9]
-- >         , (f, m) <- [(W.greedyView, 0), (W.shift, shiftMask)]]
--
-- This should change to
--
-- > keyBindings conf = let m = modMask conf in fromList $
-- >     {- lots of other keybindings -}
-- >     [((m .|. modm, k), windows $ onCurrentScreen f i)
-- >         | (i, k) <- zip (workspaces' conf) [xK_1 .. xK_9]
-- >         , (f, m) <- [(W.greedyView, 0), (W.shift, shiftMask)]]
--
-- In particular, the analogue of @XMonad.workspaces@ is
-- @workspaces'@, and you can use @onCurrentScreen@ to convert functions
-- of virtual workspaces to functions of physical workspaces, which work
-- by marshalling the virtual workspace name and the currently focused
-- screen into a physical workspace name.
--
-- A complete example abusing many of the functions below is available in the
-- "XMonad.Config.Dmwit" module.

type VirtualWorkspace  = WorkspaceId
type PhysicalWorkspace = WorkspaceId

-- $converting
-- You shouldn't need to use the functions below very much. They are used
-- internally. However, in some cases, they may be useful, and so are exported
-- just in case. In general, the \"marshall\" functions convert the convenient
-- form (like \"web\") you would like to use in your configuration file to the
-- inconvenient form (like \"2_web\") that xmonad uses internally. Similarly,
-- the \"unmarshall\" functions convert in the other direction.

-- | In case you don't know statically how many screens there will be, you can call this in main before starting xmonad.  For example, part of my config reads

-- | This turns a naive pretty-printer into one that is aware of the
-- independent screens. That is, you can write your pretty printer to behave
-- the way you want on virtual workspaces; this function will convert that
-- pretty-printer into one that first filters out physical workspaces on other
-- screens, then converts all the physical workspaces on this screen to their
-- virtual names.
--
-- For example, if you have handles @hLeft@ and @hRight@ for bars on the left and right screens, respectively, and @pp@ is a pretty-printer function that takes a handle, you could write
--
-- > logHook = let log screen handle = dynamicLogWithPP . marshallPP screen . pp $ handle
-- >           in log 0 hLeft >> log 1 hRight
marshallPP :: ScreenId -> PP -> PP

    ppHidden            = ppHidden          pp . snd . unmarshall,
    ppHiddenNoWindows   = ppHiddenNoWindows pp . snd . unmarshall,
    ppUrgent            = ppUrgent          pp . snd . unmarshall,
    ppSort              = fmap (marshallSort s) (ppSort pp)
    }

-- | Take a pretty-printer and turn it into one that only runs when the current
-- workspace is one associated with the given screen. The way this works is a
-- bit hacky, so beware: the 'ppOutput' field of the input will not be invoked
-- if either of the following conditions is met:
--
-- 1. The 'ppSort' of the input returns an empty list (when not given one).
--
-- 2. The 'ppOrder' of the input returns the exact string @\"\\0\"@.
--
-- For example, you can use this to create a pipe which tracks the title of the
-- window currently focused on a given screen (even if the screen is not
-- current) by doing something like this:
--
-- > ppFocus s = whenCurrentOn s def
-- >     { ppOrder  = \(_:_:title:_) -> [title]
-- >     , ppOutput = appendFile ("focus" ++ show s) . (++ "\n")
-- >     }
--
-- Sequence a few of these pretty-printers to get a log hook that keeps each
-- screen's title up-to-date.
