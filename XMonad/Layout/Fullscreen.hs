-- $usage
-- Provides a ManageHook and an EventHook that sends layout messages
-- with information about fullscreening windows. This allows layouts
-- to make their own decisions about what they should to with a
-- window that requests fullscreen.
--
-- The module also includes a few layout modifiers as an illustration
-- of how such layouts should behave.
--
-- To use this module, add 'fullscreenEventHook' and 'fullscreenManageHook'
-- to your config, i.e.
--
-- > xmonad def { handleEventHook = fullscreenEventHook,
-- >              manageHook = fullscreenManageHook,
-- >              layoutHook = myLayouts }
--
-- Now you can use layouts that respect fullscreen, for example the
-- provided 'fullscreenFull':
--
-- > myLayouts = fullscreenFull someLayout
--

-- | Modifies your config to apply basic fullscreen support -- fullscreen
-- windows when they request it. Example usage:
--
-- > main = xmonad
-- >      $ fullscreenSupport
-- >      $ def { ... }
fullscreenSupport :: LayoutClass l Window =>
  XConfig l -> XConfig (ModifiedLayout FullscreenFull l)
fullscreenSupport c = c {
    layoutHook = fullscreenFull $ layoutHook c,
    handleEventHook = handleEventHook c <+> fullscreenEventHook,
    manageHook = manageHook c <+> fullscreenManageHook,
    startupHook = startupHook c <+> fullscreenStartup
  }

-- | fullscreenSupport with smartBorders support so the border doesn't
-- show when the window is fullscreen
--
-- > main = xmonad
-- >      $ fullscreenSupportBorder
-- >      $ def { ... }
fullscreenSupportBorder :: LayoutClass l Window =>
    XConfig l -> XConfig (ModifiedLayout FullscreenFull
    (ModifiedLayout SmartBorder (ModifiedLayout FullscreenFull l)))

-- | Messages that control the fullscreen state of the window.
-- AddFullscreen and RemoveFullscreen are sent to all layouts

-- FullscreenChanged is sent to the current layout after one
