Layout modifier that tracks focus in the tiled layer while the floating layer
is in use. This is particularly helpful for tiled layouts where the focus
determines what is visible.

The relevant bugs are Issue 4 and 306:

{- $usage

Apply to your layout in a config like:

> main = xmonad (def{
>                   layoutHook = trackFloating (useTransientFor
>                       (noBorders Full ||| Tall 1 0.3 0.5)),
>                   ...
>               })


'useTransientFor' and 'trackFloating' can be enabled independently.  For
example when the floating window sets @WM_TRANSIENT_FOR@, such as libreoffice's
file->preferences window, @optionA@ will have the last-focused window magnified
while @optionB@ will result magnify the window that opened the preferences
window regardless of which tiled window was focused before.

> import XMonad.Layout.Magnifier
> import XMonad.Layout.TrackFloating
>
> underlyingLayout = magnifier (Tall 1 0.3 0.5)
>
> optionA = trackFloating underlyingLayout
> optionB = trackFloating (useTransientFor underlyingLayout)

{- | Runs another layout with a remembered focus, provided:

* the subset of windows doesn't include the focus in XState

* it was previously run with a subset that included the XState focus

* the remembered focus hasn't since been killed

trackFloating layout = ModifiedLayout (TrackFloating False Nothing) layout

{- $layoutModifier
It also corrects focus issues for full-like layouts inside other layout
modifiers:

> import XMonad.Layout.IM
> import XMonad.Layout.Tabbed
> import XMonad.Layout.TrackFloating
> import XMonad.Layout.Reflect

> gimpLayout = withIM 0.11 (Role "gimp-toolbox") $ reflectHoriz
>       $ withIM 0.15 (Role "gimp-dock") (trackFloating simpleTabbed)

Interactions with some layout modifiers (ex. decorations, minimizing) are
unknown but likely unpleasant.
